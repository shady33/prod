This is the main release/development repository for TinyOS.

These are some initial thoughts on doing maintanence for TinyOS release cycles.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.   Input is encouraged.   If tinyos-devel@millennium.berkeley.edu
isn't appropriate (should be, but YMMV), send them to me cire831@gmail.com.

However, it would be prefered if you comment using github by looking at the commit that
brought this file into tp-freeforall.



The mainline of the TinyProd family of repositories is an initial cut at a structure for how
to manage this. The mainline is gh:tinyprod/prod (the main pristine release fork).
gh:tp-freeforall/prod is the development fork where most new work is done.   tp-freeforall
(aka. ffa) actively tracks the current SVN tinyos development repository.

The general form for a repository/branch is: <github_context>/<repo>(branch)
ie. gh:tp-freeforall/prod (svn/current) is the svn/current branch in the
tp-freeforall/prod repository located on github.


See the following documents for more details on how this github stuff is put together...

https://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod/blob/tp-master/<filename>

00a_Repo_Notes: For a general overview of what the tp-freeforall repo is about.
 
00b_Development_Environment: Setting up a development environment for the msp430.

00c_Getting_Started_Git: Overview of getting started using git, github, and the repo.

00d_Contribution_Process: Contributing back to the central Repository.   Work in Progress.




In the meantime the following branches and tags are proposed to move us in a reasonable direction.

Tags are used to denote the main tinyos 2.1.2 releases and its maintanence releases.

ie.

tos-2_1_2_0 is the initial release of 2.1.2 (same as release_tinyos_2_1_2).

tos-2_1_2_1 is the 1st maintanence release of 2.1.2.   It contains a batch of
patches from the development trunk so doesn't have the need for any cherry picked
bugs, etc.


Branches:

Currently, the following branches exist between the working TinyOS development
repository and the TinyProd family of repos.

master: In general, master refers to the default main branch in a GIT repository.
Currently, master refers to the master branch coming from the T2-SVN development
repository.

tos-maint: the mainline maintanence branch.

tos-maint-next: a branch holding proposed changes destined for the next maintanence release.


svn/current: a tracking branch that tracks master.




First, why a seperate TinyProd/prod repository for releases?   This is to minimize
how much other cruft is held in the repository.  If you want to see the cruft and 
are okay with dealing with the associated overhead, use the TP-FREEFORALL repository.

The intent is to keep most ordinary uses from having to pull the other objects that we
as developers are generating.


The maintanence branches and tags will in the future all be managed out of the Release
repository (ie. TinyProd/prod).   Currently, while gestating these are replicated in both
tp-freeforall as well as tinyprod.
