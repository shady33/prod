Component: SoftwareSpi
Description: software SPI implementation

Usage:
This implements the SpiPacket and SpiByte interfaces in software, using three general I/O pins.

Clock polarity and phase
From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus, which has a picture: 

In addition to setting the clock frequency, the master must also configure the clock polarity
and phase with respect to the data. Freescale's SPI Block Guide [1] names these two options
as CPOL and CPHA respectively, and most vendors have adopted that convention.

At CPOL=0 the base value of the clock is zero 
For CPHA=0, data are read on the clock's rising edge (low->high transition) and data are changed on a falling edge (high->low clock transition).
For CPHA=1, data are read on the clock's falling edge and data are changed on a rising edge.

At CPOL=1 the base value of the clock is one (inversion of CPOL=0) 
For CPHA=0, data are read on clock's falling edge and data are changed on a rising edge.
For CPHA=1, data are read on clock's rising edge and data are changed on a falling edge.

That is, CPHA=0 means sample on the leading (first) clock edge, while CPHA=1 means sample
on the trailing (second) clock edge, regardless of whether that clock edge is rising or falling.
Note that with CPHA=0, the data must be stable for a half cycle before the first clock cycle.
Also, note that no matter what the CPOL and CPHA modes say, the initial clock value must be
stable before the chip select line goes active.
