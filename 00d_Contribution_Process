00a_Contribution_Process

This document describes and gives details for how to contribute to the TinyProd
repositories.

1) Notation:

  * We reference a fictional developer throughout this document, Robert Hunter,
    whose initials are rh.

  * Github has a notion of context and repositories are owned by that context.
    Contexts maybe a github owner or maybe a github organization which can
    associate owners and contributors and associate them to a repository.

    gh:<context>/<repo> is used to refer to a repository hosted on
    github.com.

    local: refers to your local working repository.

  * Branch names are presented in parentheses.
    ie: "gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int)" is the msp430-int branch
    in the tp-freeforall/prod.git repository (on github.com).
    "local(msp430-int)" refers to the msp430-int branch in your local
    working repository.

    Note: local(msp430-int) and gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int)
    are not necessarily the same git object.   If the local repository has
    diverged (or if gh:tp-freeforall/prod has diverged) then these objects
    will most certainly not be the same.

  * Remote branch names.

    Remote branches take the form "remotes/<remote>/<branch_name>".   A local
    git repository can be configured to refer to remote git repositories using
    the "git remote add" command.  When data is fetched from that repository
    the branches references will be prepended with the "remotes/<remote>"
    prefix.

    Remote branches when unique may be referenced using any of the following
    forms:

        remotes/<remote>/<branch_name>	full specification.

	<remote>/<branch_name>

	<branch_name			needs to be unique


2) Where do you do your work?

    We are using Github to coordinate and host our main repositories.  Each contributor
    has access to the following:

    gh:tinyprod/prod		main release repository for TinyProd.

    gh:tp-freeforall/prod	integration repository.	 Intended to be open
				season for commits.  Integration branches
				are used to bring different development threads
				together.

    gh:<github_user>/prod	developer fork of tp-freeforall.  Used to host
				published developer branches.  Refered to as the
				developer repo.

    local			local developer repository.  Located on the
				development system.  Where the actual work
				gets done.  Refered to as Developer Local or
				just "local".

				pushes and pulls to gh:<github_user>/prod

3) Common Branch Names.

   There are several persistent branches in the tinyprod and tp-freeforall
   repositories.  Also persistent branches will be created for ongoing
   integration efforts for various features or efforts.

VeryBlessed (release) repository:  (gh:tinyprod/prod)

   master:	The main release line in TinyProd.   Current stable point.
   master-next: next updates, accepted and integrated.
   master-pu:	1st staged changes.  Go into <next>

   svn/upstream: tracks the upstream SVN T2 trunk.  This is manually updated
		 to schedule potential impact on downstream development.
                 This marks the base branch point for TinyProd.

   master-pu feeds master-next which feeds master.   When the next release
   is done, master-next becomes master and new master-next and master-pu
   branches are started.


Blessed (integration) repository: (gh:tp-freeforall/prod)

   Typically branches from the TinyProd repository will be tracked in the
   tp-freeforall/prod repository.   In addition, feature integration and other
   integration branches will exist to facilitate cooperation/convergence
   between distributed developers.

   integration:		If multiple features need to be merged into a single
			whole this is where that happens.

   <feature>-int:	main integration branch for a feature.	ie.
			gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int) is the
			integration branch for the new msp430 core
			being brought into tinyos.

    <feature>-int-next: ie. gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int-next)
			Accepted changes updates for the feature.  Will
			get merged into <feature>-int.

    <feature>-int-pu:	ie. gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int-pu)
			proposed updates for the feature.

    Note that branches are only created if the complexity of the development
    structure warrants this complexity.	This is left up to the discretion
    of the integration manager.


Local repository:

    The above branches will show up in the local repository based off remotes.

    Typically there will be an origin remote ("origin") for the developers
    repo from github, and an upstream remote ("up") for the source repo that
    the developer forked, (gh:tp-freeforall/prod).	The upstream tracks
    changes as they become integrated and allows the developer to track these
    changes locally.

    For example, we might see the following (assuming the developer Robert
    Hunter):

    bash(30): git remote -v show
    origin	git@github.com:roberthunter/prod.git
    up		git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.git

    remotes/up/master		    current branch values from the upstream
    remotes/up/svn/upstream	    tp-freeforall/prod at the time of the last
    remotes/up/msp430-int	    fetch.  Note: -pu may or may not exist.
    remotes/up/msp430-int-pu

    remotes/origin/rh		    branch values from the developers published
    remotes/origin/master	    repository at the time the repository was
    remotes/origin/svn/upstream	    originally forked or if the branches are
    remotes/origin/msp430-int	    updated by the developer.  (not automatic).
    remotes/origin/msp430-int-pu


    Typically, the developer will only update origin branches for those
    branches of immediate concern.  Typically, the working branch (rh) and the
    feature branch being integrated with.


4) Creating your published and working repositories and associated working branches.

  o Log in to your github account

  o Create a working fork.  Working repos are forked off the integration
  repository, gh:tp-freeforall/prod.   See the url:

	https://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod

    This will bring up the main page for the tp-freeforall/prod repo.

    To create a working repo, click on the fork button.	  This will create a
    fork of tp-freeforall/prod in your local context (your login context).

    This will create the repository github.com/<github_username>/prod
    which is forked off github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.	All working repos are
    forked off the tp-freeforall/prod repo.  This is to keep the amount of
    extra data in the main repository (tinyprod/prod) down to a minimum.

    For our virtual user this will create the repository
    gh:roberthunter/prod

  o Create your local repo.

    mkdir -p w/rh		# create working directory
    cd w/rh
    git clone git@github.com:roberthunter/prod.git tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x

    # you will now have w/rh/tinyos-2.x populated with the default branch
    # of the fork.  Your fork will inherit the default branch from
    # tp-freeforall/prod repo.	Currently this is msp430-int.  This is of
    # course subject to change, and you should check the current state to
    # see where you are.
    #
    # this will create the remote origin linked to your working fork on github.

    # you will also want to track changes coming into tp-freeforall, so
    # create a remote that will be used for tracking.	And pull in information
    # from the repository.  You can use the remote "up", for upstream, in your
    # local repository to track the upstream repository.

    git remote add up git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.git
    git fetch up

  o Create your working branch.	 For Robert Hunter we use his initials
    as the working branch name.	 This will be published as
    gh:roberthunter/prod(rh) if this branch is pushed (published)
    to Robert Hunter's Developer Repository (on github).

    git branch				# make sure on the appropriate branch
					# should show msp430-int which is the
					# current default branch.
    git checkout -t up/msp430-int	# create a tracking branch.
    git checkout -b rh			# create the working branch off the
					# current branch (msp430-int)

    <make changes>

    git add -u				# add changed files that are tracked.
    git commit				# commit.  editor will get invoked
					# for the commit message.

    # please see Guidelines in 00_Getting_Started for a guide on how to write
    # good commit messages.   It really is important to write decent commit
    # messages.

    # when you are ready to publish your changes, push the changes back to
    # your working fork on github.

    git push origin rh


5) Workflow:  (simulated github user: Robert Hunter)

    on github, fork github.com/tp-freeforall/prod  (as Robert Hunter)
    (this creates the developer repo on github, github.com/roberthunter/prod)

    The feature branch that Robert is working on is msp430 core integration.
    The main branch is msp430-int and updates get brought in via msp430-int-pu,
    (proposed updates).  If msp430-int-pu doesn't exist then a different mechanism
    is being used (direct commits to msp430-int).

    Robert's working branch (rh) starts off msp430-int.

    When the initial local repository is created (via cloning) the remote
    "origin" is created.  In the example below this refers to git@github.com:
    roberthunter/prod.git and is read/write (assuming Robert set up his github
    account properly with his SSH key).

    We also want a remote for the upstream called "up", for upstream.  In this
    example the upstream is always the repository Robert forked from,
    gh:tp-freeforall/prod.

    mkdir -p ~/w/rh
    cd ~/w/rh
    git clone git@github.com:roberthunter/prod.git tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git remote add up git://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.git
    git fetch up
    git checkout -t up/msp430-int	  # create a local tracking branch
    git checkout -b rh			  # create the rh branch off msp430-int

    # We are publishing the new values for the branches rh and msp430-int
    # in gh:roberthunter/prod.  The values of these branches in the local
    # repository are remotes/origin/rh and remotes/origin/msp430-int.  Not
    # to be confused with remotes/up/msp430-int which is the branch state
    # recorded locally about the upstream remote repository.
    
    git push origin rh
    git push origin msp430-int


Robert Hunter makes changes and commits his working branch (rh) to his local
repository.

He may also publish his working branch to his developer repository
on github (gh:roberthunter/prod(rh)) to allow others to observe what
he is doing.

He will also want to keep his working branch (rh) up to date with the
main branch he cares about, msp430-int from the upstream.
(gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int)).

When he is happy with the state of his development, he brings his commits
into his local copy of the msp430-int branch, (he first needs to make
sure that local(msp430-int) is up to date wrt the upstream,
gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int)).

The new local version of the integration branch (local(msp430-int)) is 
what you would like the upstream msp430-int to look like after your
changes are applied.  This local copy gets published to the developer's
repository at github (gh:roberthunter/prod(msp430-int) and a pull request
is generated.  The upstream (gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int)) pulls the
changes yielding the new upstream.


Succinctly:

* Making changes to the local working area and repository (local(rh)).

    mkdir -p ~/w/rh
    cd ~/w/rh/tinyos-2.x		   # inside existing local repo
    git checkout rh			   # branch off msp430-int

       work work work, busy little bee
       keep commits small and logical
       use good commit messages.

    git add -u <blah> <blah> <blah>	   # add to index
    git commit				   # check the changes in, msg in editor



Another operation routinely done is updating working branches from the
integration master (ie. msp430-int).

For example, Robert wants to make sure that his changes are consistent with
what is happening on the tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int) branch.  He
accomplishes this by the following commands:

    cd ~/w/rh/tinyos-2.x
    git fetch up			 # get current information from
					 # tp-freeforall

    git checkout rh			 # make sure on rh branch
    git merge up/msp430-int		 # merge in the current
					 # proposed integration branch
					 # which is the feature Robert is
					 # working on.

* refreshing the local copy of msp430-int

    git checkout msp430-int		   # integration branch is msp430-int
    git fetch up			   # update from the upstream
    git merge up/msp430-int		   # make sure our local is up to date


* Update local branch with upstream changes.

  Integrate changes from up/msp430-int into the working repository.	One
  mechanism assumes relatively simple changes so uses "git-rebase" to move
  the working branch on to the new tip of msp430-int.

  WARNING: This is only recommended here because the local(rh) branch is
  intended to be private and not a published branch used by others to base
  their work on.  In other words, it is expressly assumed that others will
  not be forking or basing their work on branch names (git objects) inherited
  from a private developer repository.

  If people will be sharing state from your private developer repository don't
  use rebase.  Rather all of your repository branch manipulation should be
  done using "git merge" rather than "git rebase".

  "git rebase" is suggested because it keeps your commits grouped together.  This
  results in some what cleaner and easier to read histories.

    git checkout msp430-int		# refresh local copy
    git fetch up
    git merge up/msp430-int
    git checkout rh			# switch back to working
    git rebase msp430-int

    # rh has now been rewritten to be on the new tip of msp430-int as
    # imported from the upstream.


* Move the current local(rh) branch to the tip of the updated msp430-int
  and publish the result.

    # the simplest method assumes that all of the most current changes on the
    # rh branch are getting pulled over into msp430-int.   We first rebase
    # the rh branch onto the tip of the msp430-int to clean up the history
    # and then simply fast forward msp430-int

    # first make sure msp430-int is current

    git checkout msp430-int
    git fetch up
    git merge up/msp430-int

    git checkout rh
    git rebase msp430-int		   # move rh to tip of map430-int
    git checkout msp430-int
    git merge rh			   # advance msp430-int to include rh
					   # should be a fast-forward

    # if you have published rh at gh:roberthunter/prod(rh) then you will have
    # to override the remote branch when you push.   This is because the SHAs of
    # rh change when you rebase.  The history of rh has completely changed (because
    # of the rebase) and so the SHAs are competely different with a different
    # history.  The history has been rewritten to be based off the current version
    # of msp430-int.
    #
    # If you don't publish your current working branch you don't need to do this
    # because the branch rh doesn't exist or isn't being moved.

    git push origin +rh			# only if you publish.
    git push origin msp430-int		# publish the new version of msp430-int


* Complicated move of particular commits from working branch to local msp430-int

    # If the change set is complicated or if only pieces of the change set
    # needs to be brought over, then cherry-pick should be used.

    git checkout msp430-int		# local msp430-int branch
    git fetch up
    git merge up/msp430-int		# make sure up to date with upstream

    # for each commit on rh that needs to be included in msp430-int
    git cherry-pick <sha-of-commit-on-rh>


* Looking at differences between working branch and integration branch

    # To see what changes you are bringing over use the following:
    git log --oneline up/msp430-int..msp430-int

    # to see the changes you are bringing over
    git diff up/msp430-int msp430-int


* Publishing.

When the new msp430-int is ready, push it back to your published fork on
github: ie. gh:roberthunter/prod(msp430-int).

    git push origin msp430-int

Robert then requests a pull from his repositories main page.

    https://github.com/roberthunter/prod/pull/new/msp430-int

This requests a pull from gh:roberthunter/prod(msp430-int) to
gh:tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int).


* Further Integration

If a ProposedUpdates branch is being use, ie. msp430-int-pu, this branch
will be periodically be reviewed and changes will be brought into the main
feature branch, msp430-int.

After the upstream merge is complete, developers using msp430-int should
refresh their local copies of the upstream branch.

After other changes from other developers comes in and msp430-int has
sufficiently matured, msp430-int-pu is merged into tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int).

TESTING of the integration branches happens on tp-freeforall/prod(feature-int).
Groups of features are combined on gh:tp-freeforall/prod(pu) [proposed updates],
which migrates to the next branch as the branch matures and the changes are accepted.

When all integration branches have matured sufficiently, they are merged
together, tested, and becomes tinyprod/prod(master) as a new release.   The
intent is to release features as they become available using a continuous
release process.


* Backmerging

While various integration work is being done, working branches should be
refreshed with more current content from the integration repositories.  This
is referred to as a backmerge.

After a proposal has been accepted and integrated into the integration branch,
it is important to update the state of the local and working repos with the
new integration branch data.   This will effectively move the working branches
onto the tip of the new integration branch (msp430-int-pu).

Replace msp430-int-pu with msp430-int if a PU branch is not being used for
the integration work.

    cd ~/w/rh/tinyos-2.x
    git fetch up			# get current upstream data
    git checkout msp430-int-pu		# update local copy
    git merge up/msp430-int-pu
    git checkout rh			# switch to working branch
    git rebase msp430-int-pu		# move to tip of integration

	or

    git merge msp430-int-pu		# depending.
